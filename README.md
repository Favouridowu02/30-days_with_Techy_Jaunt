# 🚀 30 DAYS TECH CHALLENGE with TechyJoint 🔧💻🔐

**By: Idowu Favour**  
_Backend Developer | Cybersecurity Enthusiast | Mechanical Engineer_

Welcome to my 30-day challenge with **TechyJoint**, where I embark on a multidisciplinary tech journey integrating **Backend Development**, **Cybersecurity**, and **Mechanical Engineering**. This challenge aims to demonstrate the synergy between software and hardware, security and systems, theory and practice.

---

## 🧭 Overview

For 30 days, I’ll be working on projects and tasks that span:

- ⚙️ **Mechanical Engineering** – Bridging hardware and automation with intelligent systems.
- 🖥️ **Backend Development** – Building robust APIs and services for real-world applications.
- 🔐 **Cybersecurity** – Implementing security best practices and developing security tools.

Each week features a new theme, with projects that merge two or more focus areas.

---

## 📌 Objectives

- Build **practical and functional projects**.
- Improve hands-on experience across different technical domains.
- Apply cybersecurity principles in backend and hardware systems.
- Document daily progress with code, design, and insights.
